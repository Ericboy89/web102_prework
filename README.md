## Notes

Handling Dynamic Content Updates: One of the challenges I faced was implementing the dynamic updating of the game list based on the user’s selection (e.g., funded vs. unfunded games). Initially, the logic wasn’t correctly filtering the games when the buttons were pressed, but after carefully revisiting the event handling functions, I was able to ensure the list updates without refreshing the page.
